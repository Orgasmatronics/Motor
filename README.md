### Motor

This is a modular system for manufacturing motors scalably from the waste streams of consumer capitalism.   

The system consists of:

1. a control board
2. drive and pickup coils
3. energy storage
4. mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion circuits
4. modular mechanical framing system
5. mechanical oscillators(mass + spring)
6. bearings, shafts and drive trains
7. IoT interface


Taken together, the components of this system should be usable to construct machines that can automate the manufacture of more components of the system, creating the ability to self-propagate.  

As of now(November 2015) there are several parts that have to be either bought or made with commercial tools like the 3d printer.  A ongoing goal of this project is to replace all those components so that the whole project can be re-created from scratch using waste streams _only_.
