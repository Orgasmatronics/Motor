Print each of these twice and attach them together using JB Weld or similar epoxy.  Wind the sensor coil with varnished 30 AWG copper wire until full, wrap around ring and twist when full to prevent unwrapping, then solder a 2 pin header to the wires to connect to the board using a Samtec cable with sockets. Wrap drive coil with 24 AWG varnished copper wire until almost full, wrap in electrical tape until sealed, twist wires together, solder to another 2 pin header as with sense coil.  

Repeat this twice to make a full set with two drive coils and two sense coils, which will be one of the default settings for systems with coil driver boards version 4.
